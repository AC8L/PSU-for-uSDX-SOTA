# PSU-for-uSDX-SOTA

This is a re-work and size change of an original portable power supply by WB2CBA (https://antrak.org.tr/blog/usdx-sdr-ssb-sota-transceiver-battery-pack/).

It is done to fit the PSU into the same size enclosure as uSDX SOTA transceiver itself.

Design was slightly modified to use different BMS unit, as the original one that Barb used is not easily available.
This mis the example of the new BMS unit used: https://a.co/d/hkYq5Yx

Also, I used THD version of nattery holders because they fit thew PCB design.
